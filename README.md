## Iâ€™m currently learning
Outside of University, I am working to develop my skill with C++. Whilst it is an extremely powerful language, I have had more exposure to C, so I am focusing on Object Oriented Paradigms in preparation to my chosen career path. <br> <br>

## Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
Do not hesitate to contact me for collaboration opportunities involving either C, C++ or Java. I would really like to get involved in larger projects and put my skill set to use wherever possible! <br> <br>
